# Memories of Evolution X

**Why did I create this repository?** (I referred to Akito Mizukito)

I wanted to do something creative, something no one in the community has ever done.

**How do i participate?**

It's easy!

You make a folder in KeepEvolving folder, name it as your GitHub username!

For Example, KeepEvolving/RealAkito

Then make a file called KeepEvolving.ext (By .ext it can be .txt, .py, .sh, .go, js and much more!) then type KeepEvolving in your own language and your country!

~~ Example ~~
KeepEvolving.txt
`進化し続ける - With love from Tokyo, Japan`

(You can make more than one KeepEvolving file, Ex in python as KeepEvolving.py)

**YOU CAN START MAKING PULL REQUEST AND PARTICIPATE WITH US NOW!**

## Historical Information

**Evolution X, Founded by Joey Huab (Stallix) and has 2 co. founders, Akito Mizukito (RealAkito) and Anierin Bliss (AnierinB)**


### How did Evolution X get founded?

I (In here, referred to Joey Huab) wanted to have my own version of a Pixel ROM but Pixel Experience beat me to it. So I applied for official maintainership. After getting kicked, I kept doing unofficial builds until I said I should build my own.

### How did I get kicked from maintaining official Pixel Experience?

Putting VoLTE icon support into official build.

### What we planned to do next?

We're supposed to bringup Android Q for Evolution X (Evolution X Q) once Google publicly release the source codes!
