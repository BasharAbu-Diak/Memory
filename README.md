### Why was Evolution X created?

Joey huab: I wanted to build my own version of a Pixel ROM, but Pixel Experience beat me to it. So, I applied for official maintainership. After sometime, my maintainership was revoked. I continued compiling unofficial builds until I decieded that I should build my own ROM. And that's where all this started!

### Why was my device maintainership revoked from Pixel Experience?

I included VoLTE icon support into official build.

### What do we have planed next?

Evolution X bringup for Android Q (Evolution X Q) once Google publicly release's the source code!
